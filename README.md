# COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University

### Goals

1. Provide COVID19 dataset containing detailed information on Russia.
2. Maintain CSSE compatibility
3. Provide some higher level APIs for accessing the data.
4. Close the project after a more systematic approch is developed

* [Upstream issue](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/1262)
* [Generic local discussion (if any)](https://github.com/grwlf/COVID-19_plus_Russia/issues/1)

_Disclamer: the author doesn't have relationships with any official and
commercial organisations. The data provided there is collected from unreliable
sources and may not be accurate. Please use it at your own risk._

### Contents

* `csse_covid_19_data` contains CSV files which were released by CSSE and later
  amended by us.
* [python3](./python3) folder contains stub and development tools:
  - `covid19ru.check` module for checking certain invariants
  - `covid19ru.fetch` Yandex data fetcher

### Data

#### Data source description

* https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
  - Upstream world data by CSSE.
* [Rospotrebnadzor](https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/about/info/news/)
  - The supposedly original official data source of COVID19 data in Russia.
    Data is published in Russian as a plain text. The source provides daily
    difference per region and current total for the whole state. Example:
    <https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/about/info/news/news_details.php?ELEMENT_ID=14125>
* [Yandex COVID19 map](https://yandex.ru/maps/covid19)
  - The Yandex company provides current per-region numbers.
* [NovelCoronaVirusChannel at Telegram](https://t.me/NovelCoronaVirusChannel)
  - Random COVID19 news in Russian.
* <https://стопкоронавирус.рф//#>


#### Update procedure

Originally, author filled the data on Moscow and Saint Petersburg manually,
based on `Rospotrebnadzor` and `NovelCoronaVirusChannel` data. Starting from
March, 25 we follow the below procedure:

1. Fetch hourly data from `Yandex COVID map`
    - Fetching is done by running `monitor` function of the [fetcher
      script](./python3/src/covid19ru/fetch.py)
    - The data is saved into `pending` folder, stamped with UTC time.
2. Fetch daily upstream updates by using regular `git fetch` manually.
3. If update is available,
    1. Rebase repository to `upstream/master` branch using `git rebase`
    2. For every `csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports` file which doesn't
       have russian details, do the following:
        1. Determine the update time of 'Russia' record found in the world data.
           The time is supposed to be UTC. The update time is often near `23:30`
           (supposedly UTC time).
        2. Find the russian details dump in `pending` folder which has the
           closest UTC timestamp.
        3. Update world information file by inserting russian details manually.
        4. Review the format compatibility (CSV fields order, date format, etc.).
        5. Run the [checker script](./python3/src/covid19ru/check.py).
        6. Commit the changes to this repository.

### Roadmap

* Python code to check the correctness of CSV files
  - ~~Python stub checking the validity of basic CSV structure~~ (see
    [./python3/src/covid19ru/check.py](./python3/src/covid19ru/check.py) )
  - Check less-trivial invariants
* Python API to access the CSV data. It should handle the CSV format change
  which happened around 23.03.2020
  - Pandas API
  - Provide compatibility level for data before 23.03.2020
  - ???
* Semi-automated data loader from Yandex. Ideally, we want to perform the
  following actions:
  - ~~Collect `Confirmed/Death/Recovered` info for each Russian city~~ (starting
    from `03-25-2020.csv`)
  - ~~Save this information in a temporary file to handle update gap~~
  - ~~Set correct value of Longitude/Latitude for Russian regions~~
  - Figure out what does 'Active' field mean and how to get it.
    * Seems that it is just `Confirmed-Deaths-Recovered`. One have to update the
      data which miss this value.
  - Daily update CSSE with Russian state information
* Find data on Russian regions for pre- 25.03.2020 period.

### Log

#### 25.03.2020

* Conflict resolved. `23-22-2020.csv` file seemed to be damaged by the upstream admins.
* <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/1523>
* Implemented Yandex data fetcher

#### 23.03.2020

Upstream format change: now

* `,,Moscow,Russia,2020-03-24 00:00:00,55.75222,37.61556,262,1,9,,"Moscow, Russia"`
* `,,"Saint Petersburg",Russia,2020-03-22 00:00:00,59.93863,30.31413,16,0,2,,"Saint Petersburg, Russia"`

#### 21.03.2020

We augmented CSV files from `csse_covid_19_daily_reports` folder by adding lines
like:

* `Moscow,Russia,2020-03-21T00:00:00,5,0,0,55.75222,37.61556`
* `"Saint Petersburg",Russia,2020-03-21T00:00:00,4,0,2,59.93863,30.31413`
